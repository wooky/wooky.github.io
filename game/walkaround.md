## How to Play?

* Start each level by pressing the "S" button. Memorize the password given at the bottom of the screen.
* Use your mouse to get to the "F" button without touching any of the walls.
* Press the "F" button, type in the password at the bottom of the screen, then press the "F" button again.
* If you get the password right, the level is completed, and you move to the next level.
* If you get the password wrong, *press the "F" button again*, then re-type the password. If you forgot the password, you'll need to go back to the "S" button.
* Each level has a time limit, so be aware of that.
* This game is equipped with a *sophisticated* anti-cheat mechanism, so don't try anything sneaky.

Good luck!
