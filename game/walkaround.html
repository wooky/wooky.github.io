<h2>How to Play?</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Start each level by pressing the "S" button. Memorize the password given at the bottom of the screen.</li>
  <li>Use your mouse to get to the "F" button without touching any of the walls.</li>
  <li>Press the "F" button, type in the password at the bottom of the screen, then press the "F" button again.</li>
  <li>If you get the password right, the level is completed, and you move to the next level.</li>
  <li>If you get the password wrong, <i>press the "F" button again</i>, then re-type the password. If you forgot the password, you'll need to go back to the "S" button.</li>
  <li>Each level has a time limit, so be aware of that.</li>
  <li>This game is equipped with a <i>sophisticated</i> anti-cheat mechanism, so don't try anything sneaky.</li>
</ul>
Good luck!
